## Project 1: Cirrhosis 
- Created a tool that determines what factors are affected by patients with Cirrhosis vs. those who do not. 
  - Factors tested include ascites, spiders, edema, bilirubin, cholesterol, tryglicerides, and etc. 
- Performed data cleaning in Python by omitting irrelevant attributes and removing duplicates/empty data.
- Extracted insights on the distribution of certain attributes through the creation of graphs using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Performed data filtering and data manipulation to categorize and classify patients who use a certain drug to treat Cirrhosis and those who have a specific symptom/condition.
  - e.g.: Classified those with Ascites, which is a condition in which fluid collects within your abdomen, into 1 (yes) or 0 (no) to determine if there's a correlation between Ascites and Cirrhosis.
- Created a model of the decision tree algorithm to predict the response for the data given. 
  - Accuracy produced: 71.43%, indicating the model has good accuracy.
